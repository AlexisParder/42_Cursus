A system-administration project centered around installing and configuring a secure Linux virtual machine from scratch. The goal is to enforce strict security and compliance rules, including user/group management, minimum password policies, a hardened SSH setup, and a custom firewall configuration. The project also requires monitoring system resources through a custom script and documenting the entire setup using rigorous guidelines. This project strengthens understanding of Linux fundamentals, privilege management, security hardening, virtualization, and reproducible system configuration.
