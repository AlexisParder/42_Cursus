## Description
A system-administration project centered around installing and configuring a secure Linux virtual machine from scratch. The goal is to enforce strict security and compliance rules, including user/group management, minimum password policies, a hardened SSH setup, and a custom firewall configuration. The project also requires monitoring system resources through a custom script and documenting the entire setup using rigorous guidelines. This project strengthens understanding of Linux fundamentals, privilege management, security hardening, virtualization, and reproducible system configuration.

## Script Monitoring.sh
The script must always be able to display the following information:
- The architecture of your operating system and its kernel version.
- The number of physical processors.
- The number of virtual processors.
- The current available RAM on your server and its utilization rate as a percentage.
- The current available storage on your server and its utilization rate as a percentage.
- The current utilization rate of your processors as a percentage.
- The date and time of the last reboot.
- Whether LVM is active or not.
- The number of active connections.
- The number of users using the server.
- The IPv4 address of your server and its MAC (Media Access Control) address.
- The number of commands executed with the sudo program.
