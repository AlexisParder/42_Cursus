# libft
*This project has been created as part of the 42 curriculum by achauvie.*

## Description
A foundational project from the 42 curriculum.
Libft consists of recreating a custom version of the standard C library by implementing a wide set of essential functions for memory manipulation, string handling, character checks, and linked list operations.
This library becomes a core dependency for all subsequent projects (get_next_line, ft_printf, push_swap, minishell, etc.) and establishes strong fundamentals in low-level programming, memory management, and clean code structure.
