# pipex
*This project has been created as part of the 42 curriculum by achauvie.*

## Description
A project aimed at reproducing the behavior of Unix pipelines by redirecting input/output streams between multiple commands. The program must correctly fork processes, set up pipes, manage file descriptors, and execute commands through PATH resolution, all while ensuring strict error handling and memory safety. The bonus involves handling multiple pipes and heredoc functionality. This project reinforces mastery of processes, system calls, I/O redirection, environment variables, and inter-process communication, while teaching how to orchestrate complex data flows at the system level.

## Instructions
<!-- - Use the `make` command to generate the program.
	- Use the `make bonus` command to generate the program with bonus.
- Use the `./so_long maps/<map_file>.ber` command to start game.
	- Use the `./so_long_bonus maps/<map_file>.ber` command to start game with bonus. -->

<!-- - [x] Make the player lose when they touch an enemy patrol.
- [X] Add some sprite animation.
- [x] Display the movement count directly on screen instead of writing it in the shell. -->
