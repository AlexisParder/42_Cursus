# push_swap

A highly algorithmic project where the goal is to sort a list of integers using two stacks and a restricted set of operations.
The challenge is to design and implement an optimized sorting strategy that produces the fewest possible instructions, especially for large datasets (100–500 elements).
Common approaches include small-dataset sorting, chunk-based strategies, and radix sort.
This project develops algorithmic thinking, time/operation optimization, data structure manipulation, and implementation of complex logic under strict constraints.
