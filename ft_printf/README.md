# ft_printf
![🇫🇷 French](./README_FR.md)

## Description
A full reimplementation of the iconic printf function in C.
The project aims to handle formatted output by parsing format strings and supporting variadic arguments using stdarg.h.
It covers all mandatory conversions (c, s, p, d, i, u, x, X, %) and focuses on building a modular, well-structured, and efficient formatting engine.
This project strengthens skills in parsing logic, base conversions, buffer management, and function architecture.

## Instructions
- Use the `make` command to generate the archive.
- Export the `ft_printf.a` and `ft_printf.h` files to the program that requires the `ft_printf` function.

## Example of usage
The function is used like basic `printf`.<br>
`int printf(const char *format, ...);`
