A graphical project focused on building a small 2D game using the MiniLibX library. The objective is to implement map parsing, collision logic, sprite rendering, and event handling, while respecting a strict set of rules regarding map validity, movement constraints, and asset management. The challenge increases with the need to create smooth player interactions, handle animation cycles, and ensure proper resource cleanup. This project develops skills in low-level graphics, event-driven programming, input handling, file parsing, and memory/resource management within a constrained C environment.
