# get_next_line

A project focused on creating a function capable of reading any file, input stream, or stdin one line at a time.
The implementation must manage internal buffers, preserve unread data between calls, handle arbitrary BUFFER_SIZE values, and ensure full memory safety.
The optional bonus adds multi-file descriptor handling.
This project reinforces knowledge of file descriptors, dynamic memory, static variables, buffer logic, and robust edge-case management.
