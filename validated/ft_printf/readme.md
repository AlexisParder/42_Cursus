# ft_printf

A full reimplementation of the iconic printf function in C.
The project aims to handle formatted output by parsing format strings and supporting variadic arguments using stdarg.h.
It covers all mandatory conversions (c, s, p, d, i, u, x, X, %) and focuses on building a modular, well-structured, and efficient formatting engine.
This project strengthens skills in parsing logic, base conversions, buffer management, and function architecture.
